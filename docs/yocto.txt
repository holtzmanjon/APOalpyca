yocto module
************

Low level module to interface with Yoctopuce thermocouple to monitor
QHY600 body temperatures.

When this is instantiated, a thread is started that monitors the
thermocouples. If the temperatures are below a threshold (tcrit), a USB
relay is triggered that resets an external watchdog that passes
power to the camera.

If the body temperature exceeds some threshold (twarn), the camera cooler
power is turned off.

In addition to operational methods, class also provides attributes
and methods as required by the `ASCOM Alpaca Switch device <https://ascom-standards.org/alpyca/alpaca.switch.html>`_.
