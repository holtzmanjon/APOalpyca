safetymonitor module
********************

The safetymonitor module provides the Alpyca driver to determine whether
it is safe to open the 1m dome. This is achieved with routines implemented
in APOSafety that check the status

It implements the command set of the `ASCOM Alpaca Safetymonitor class <https://ascom-standards.org/alpyca/alpaca.safetymonitor.html>`_.

It includes a custom SupportedAction:
- override, which sets an override to suspend checking status of the other domes for a specified number of seconds
