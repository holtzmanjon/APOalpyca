Welcome to APOalpyca's documentation!
======================================

The APOalpyca package contains Alpyca drivers for several devices in
use at Apache Point Observatory:

- the 1m AshDome, implemented as an Alpaca Dome device
- a SafetyMonitor device that operates by getting shutter status of 2.5m and 3.5m
- a Zaber stage, for moving the SONG focal plane camera, implemented as an Alpaca Focuser device
- a Thorlabs 150 stage, for moving the SONG iodine cell, implemented as an Alpaca Focuser device
- a Thorlabs TC300 temperature controller, for controlling the temperature of the SONG iodine cell, implemented as an Alpaca Switch device
- the Shelyak eShel calibration module, implemented as an Alpaca Switch device

The first two run on the dome1m computer, while the others run on the pwi1m computer. These
are implemented in two separate Alpyca servers: domeapp.py runs on dome1m and runs the APOAshDome
and the APOSafetyMonitor, while app.py runs on pwi1 and runs the other devices.

The package includes the low level APOAshDome, APOSafety, lts150, zaber, tc300, and eshel
routines that provide the control of the devices. These can also be imported on their host machines
for interactive control of the devices.

The interface betyween the Alpyca server and the lower level routine are achieved through
the AlpycaDevice drivers dome.py, safetymonitor.py, focuser.py, and switch.py, which were
modified from the AlpycaDevice templates.
