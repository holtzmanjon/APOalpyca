eshel module
************


Low level module to interface with Shelyak eShel calibration unit. This
unit is controlled by a Velleman K8056 8-channel relay. While commands
are sent to set all relays with one command, the module provides an
interface for each relay to be commanded separetely, so it can be implemented
as an ASCOM Alpaca Switch device with 4 channels, specified by id parameter.
The corresponding channel are 0: quartz, 1: ThAr, 2: LED, and 3: mirror.

The K8056 status cannot be read, so it is tracked in software only.

In addition to operational methods, class also provides attributes
and methods as required by ASCOM Alpaca Switch device.
