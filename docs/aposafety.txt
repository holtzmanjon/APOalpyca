APOsafety module
****************

The APOsafety module provides functionality to determine whether
it is safe to open 1m dome based on the shutter/enclosure status of the APO
3.5m and/or 2.5m telescopes. It determines these via network calls.
Default is that it is deemed safe to open if either of the other telescopes
is open.

There is an option to override the safety check, which is implemented by
looking for a local OVERRIDE file.

In addition to operational methods, class also provides attributes
and methods as required by the `ASCOM Alpaca SafetyMonitor device <https://ascom-standards.org/alpyca/alpaca.safetymonitor.html>`_.
This implements a special SupportedAction command, override, which takes as an argument the
number of seconds for which an override should be allowed: this starts a timed thread
to write the local OVERRIDE file, and to remove it when thread terminates.
