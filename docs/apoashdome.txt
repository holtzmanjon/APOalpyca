APOAshDome module
*****************

This provides a low level interface to control the APO 1m Ash Dome.
The software controls relays on a Raspberry Pi that trigger the dome
control box to open/close upper shutter and to power dome rotation.
It provides an interface to an encoder on the dome motor to determine
the dome azimuth. It also provides the ability to sense the state
of a dome home switch.

This is achieved through instantiation of a Dome device. Upon
instantiation, two important threads are started: 

start_watchdog() toggles a relay on the dome control board every two minutes; the
control box has an internal timer that will close the dome if this
watchdog relay isn't reset.

start_weather() instantiates an Safety object from APOSafety and checks
for issafe() status every 90 seconds (which is determined from state of 3.5m
and/or 2.5m domes). If this returns False, then the dome is closed. There
is no provision for automatically reopening the dome; this needs to be tracked
by some client process.

In addition to operational methods, the class also provides attributes
and methods as required by the `ASCOM Alpaca Dome device <https://ascom-standards.org/alpyca/alpaca.dome.html>`_.
